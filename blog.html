              On the first day, we arrived in Honolulu around 10:30 am so we
              were able to have a full day experience. However, since we had to
              wake up so early, we also knew we wanted it to be kind of
              relaxing. We had to wait for our Airbnb to be ready so we could
              leave all of our stuff behind so we could move around more
              comfortably.

            <h2>About Me</h2>

            <h6>Posted by Cory on September 9, 2020</h6>

            <p>
              I have always been interested in Social Sciences and Sciences.
              Within the years I have refined my skill set through school, jobs,
              and projects. During my early years at community college, I worked
              mainly in positions that strengthened my soft skills whilst
              learning new hard skills. One of the things I did and still
              volunteer for is the Citizens Bond Oversight Committee as a member
              at the San Jose Evergreen Community College District.
