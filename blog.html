            I have been wanting to learn how to do web development for nearly 3
            years now. I have tried making small things here and there but would
            find myself taking some time off after getting stuck on the code and
            then a few months later I would remember and would want to start all
            over because I would look at it and understand what I wrote and
            could easily get back into it. However, I wouldn't be as interested
            in the project I was doing and then would start up a new and 'more
            interesting' project that I would be interested in.

              On the first day, we arrived in Honolulu around 10:30 am so we
              were able to have a full day experience. However, since we had to
              wake up so early, we also knew we wanted it to be kind of
              relaxing. We had to wait for our Airbnb to be ready so we could
              leave all of our stuff behind so we could move around more
              comfortably.

              I have always been interested in Social Sciences and Sciences.
              Throughout the years I have refined my skill set through school,
              jobs, volunteer efforts, and projects. During my time at Evergreen
              Community College, I worked mainly in positions that strengthened
              my soft skills whilst learning hard skills. I then furthered my
              education at San Jose State University. I started to gain a large
              interest in programming and data analysis.
