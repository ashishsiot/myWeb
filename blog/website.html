              I have been wanting to learn how to do web development for nearly
              3 years now. I have tried making small things here and there but
              would find myself taking some time off after getting stuck on the
              code and then a few months later I would remember and would want
              to start all over because I would look at it and understand what I
              wrote and could easily get back into it. However, I wouldn't be as
              interested in the project I was doing and then would start up a
              new and 'more interesting' project that I would be interested in.
              I then found this
              <a
                href="https://medium.com/better-programming/become-a-web-developer-in-180-days-without-cs-degree-e869395972e1"
              >
                website</a
              >
              near the end of last year and finally being done with school I
              would start working on my dream of making a website to have a
              focus and learn to do this to try and become a programmer
              professionally (been my vision since first programming nearly 3
              years ago as well.
            </p>

            <p class="postContent">
              I was excited to do this and had it set for myself to start on
              July 1st and was doing well at it for nearly a month but then I
              got my job as a Game Center Associate which started to take up my
              time of learning since I was in training. I was okay with this
              since every day I would even write a blog about what I did to even
              give myself an even stronger understanding of what I did and how I
              improved throughout this time of learning, kind of like what I am
              doing now if thinking about it. I was looking forward to after
              getting back into the groove of programming and was working longer
              than the 15 days it presented since I wanted an actual first
              website (HTML and CSS only). I was going to finish the website and
              then start up on learning basic JavaScrip, with whatever I was
              going to give myself for that to keep myself motivated. However,
              just like the other times, I kept putting it off, then COVID-19
              started and learning my wife was pregnant so I left it. And once
              again when I finally got back into it I saw the code and saw my
              idea of the website I wanted to just scrap it and start new. Now
              after finishing it I looked at it and just utilized some of it to
              make it quicker for myself and changed something for other parts.
            </p>
            <p class="postContent">
              Now with this process since I already knew some of the stuff I
              wanted to do and needed to work on I was able to quickly finish
              the main page and have the content for the Hawaii blog page. I
              needed to work on it and make it still work of having the side
              border which gave me the hardest time my first time at it. I was
              able to fix the problem after a quick look and was even able to,
              after watching lots of youtube of programming, do better code
              writing (not just div's instead of header and footer and utilize
              better class functions). After finishing what I thought was the
              toughest hurdle I then learned how hard, at the time, making a
              usable hyperlink to go to different parts of the website and image
              function to see the images when I first made my website public.
            </p>
            <p class="postContent">
              Overall, I am very glad I can honestly say I worked on web
              development at the beginning of the year because I was able to
              learn the basics of HTML and CSS and then doing it again this time
              with this website. I can see that I did grow and learn a lot more
              this second time of building the website. I am now excited to
              implement a new section called projects to allow myself to show
              off all of the JavaScript I will be building within this time
              doing the guide Indrek presented.

            <p class="postContent">
              For those of you who may be interested in seeing what I will be
              doing after I finish the challenge, I will do the last challenge
              of applying for a job. I will also be rebuilding my website from
              either square one or at least make it even more functional for
              myself to show it off to other people by making it more
              userfriendly.
