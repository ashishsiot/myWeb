            <p class="postContent">
              I have always been interested in Social Sciences and Sciences.
              Throughout the years I have refined my skill set through school,
              jobs, volunteer efforts, and projects. During my time at Evergreen
              Community College, I worked mainly in positions that strengthened
              my soft skills whilst learning hard skills. I then furthered my
              education at San Jose State University. I started to gain a large
              interest in programming and data analysis. I was still refining my
              skills through the people I was interacting with (i.e. Electrical
              Engineers, Communications Studies, Computer Science, Psychology).
              By working with these different individuals, I was able to gain a
              deeper understanding of how to communicate with different fields
              of education both personally and professionally.
            </p>
            <p class="postContent">
              With being a recent graduate, I have been working on personal
              growth and skills to make my knowledge of programming and
              Technical support more marketable for future employment. I have
              also been working on my biggest job of all, becoming a father. I
              have been working on making sure that my wife is calm and relaxed
              as much as I can while also working on making the room that we
              have functional for our baby.
            </p>
            <p class="postContent">
              I believe that mindfulness is also a key aspect of success and
              growth. My personal favorites are meditation, play some games
              (i.e. Baduk and video games), and just spending time with my wife
              and talking to her tummy to have some baby time. Iâ€™m currently
              working as a freelancer and volunteering and is always interested
              in a challenge. Reach out to
