            <h2>About Me</h2>

            <h6>Posted by Cory on September 9, 2020</h6>

            <p>
              I have always been interested in Social Sciences and Sciences.
              Within the years I have refined my skill set through school, jobs,
              and projects. During my early years at community college, I worked
              mainly in positions that strengthened my soft skills whilst
              learning new hard skills. One of the things I did and still
              volunteer for is the Citizens Bond Oversight Committee (CBOC) as a
              member at the San Jose Evergreen Community College District. I
              have been working with a team of people to monitor the use of bond
              money within the SJECCD. I first learned this while also working
              as a senator with the Associated Student Government at Evergreen
              Valley College.
            </p>
            <p>
              I furthered my education at San Jose State University (SJSU) I
              started to gain a large interest in programming and data analysis.
              I was still refining my skills through the people I was
              interacting with (i.e. Electrical Engineers, Communications
              Studies, Computer Science, Psychology). By working with these
              different individuals, I was able to gain a deeper understanding
              on how to communicate with different fields of education both
              personally and professionally.
            </p>
            <p>
              Since COVID-19 I have been able to utilize my eagerness to learn
              new things to my advantage with learning IT Support and Creating
              this website. I am currently looking to find a company that can
              use my experience for their benefit and could utilize my
              understanding of how to work with people to get the job done.
