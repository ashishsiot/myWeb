            <h2>Visited Hololulu, HI</h2>

            <h6>Posted by Cory on January 10, 2020</h6>

            <p>
              On the first day we arrived here around 10:30am so we were able to
              have a full day experience. However, since we had to wake up so
              early we also knew we wanted it to be kind of relaxing. We had to
              wait for our AirBnB to be ready so we could leave all of our stuff
              behind so we could move around more comfortably.
            </p>
            <p>
              The first thing we new we wanted to do is when to eat at was
              <a
                href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/lulus-waikiki-honolulu?osq=lulu"
                target="_blank">
                Lulu Waikiki
                </a>
                for their delicious Loco Moco. Afterwards, since we had to wait
              about two hours till we could check in, we went to the ABC store
              and then the Starbucks to buy some time and that is when I did my
              first bit of GIMP for my website. When we were able to then come
              to our stay and meet our host. We then stayed in the room a bit to
              rest and then conquer the the rest of the day. We then went and
              checked out an amazing sunset then decided it was finally time to
              have some dinner. We knew that we wanted to check out a lot of
              places to eat the first night and so we went to
              <a
                href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/waikiki-brewing-company-honolulu"
                target="_blank">
                Waikiki Brewing Company
              </a>
              and had their poki bowl and a sampler of their beer, we then went
              to
              <a
                href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/izakaya-tako-no-ki-honolulu"
                target="_blank">
                Izakaya Tako-No-Ki
              </a>
              and some some delicious Hamachi Poke (Yellow Tail), Miso Soup, and
              Butatama. We even said we might have to check them out again to
              try the Asari Miso Soup just because it has clams in it and that
              sounds kind of interesting. The final location we went to end it
              off was a food truck place near our place called
              <a
                href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/blue-ocean-seafood-and-steak-honolulu"
                target="_blank">
                Blue Ocean Seafood and Steak
              </a>
              food trucks and got some mahi mahi and lamb shanks and some fresh
              cut pineapple.
            </p>
            <p>
              On our second day we had breakfast at
              <a
                href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/marukame-udon-honolulu"
                target="_blank">
                Marukame Udon
              </a>.
              They serve the same thing all day so if you want to eat there
              without having to wait in a long line go in the morning. After we
              had breakfast we talked with someone and booked a
              <a
                href="https://gohawaiitours.com/oahu-tours/oahu-circle-island-tour-with-turtle-snorkeling/"
                target="_blank">
                tour
                </a>
              around the island for the next day. For lunch we walked up
              <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond_Head,_Hawaii"
                target="_blank">
                Diamond Head
              </a>
              and brought our lunch from
              <a
                href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/musubi-cafe-iyasume-honolulu"
                target="_blank">
                Musubi Cafe Iyasume
                </a>.
                If you plan on walking to and up Diamond Head from the cafe it
              will take you about two hours. However, if you want to take the
              bus you could take the number 2 line and that would cut an hour
              from the trip. When we got back from the hike and bus ride back we
              rested a bit and then went and spend some time swimming in the
              ocean. Before we had our main dinner meal we went to
              <a
                href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/hula-dog-kuhio-honolulu"
                target="_blank">
                Hula Dog Kuhio
              </a>
              and
              <a
                href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/ice-cream-rolls-hawaii-honolulu"
                target="_blank">
                Ice Cream Rolls Hawaii
              </a>
              since we mised it the night before. We then learned another
              amazing place to eat the hot dog place. The bacon taro bun is
              amazing and with the polish sausage with any of the toppings is
              just plain amazing. After we ate at Lulu and had their chicken
              wings, salmon plate and an okay Mai Tai.
            </p>
            <p>
              The third day we had to wake up early because our tour bus was
              going to pick us up at 7:20am so we had breakfast and some tea at
              <a
                href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/kai-coffee-alohilani-resort-waikiki-beach-honolulu-2?osq=Kai+Coffee+Hawai%27i"
                target="_blank">
                Kai Coffee Alohilani Resort Waikiki Beach
                </a>.
                After we had an amazing time on the trip and our tour guide was
              Jay and he made the experiance even better. The lunch was
              definitely one of many highlights besides actually being able to
              see a turtle and the monk seal. After getting back we splurged
              again for another amazing dinner experience. We knew one place we
              wanted to check out again was the Hula Dog Kuhio place and this
              time had one dog each. We also leanred that they have a rewareds
              sticker card and I feel if we learned about this the night before
              our mindset of what we would have had for dinner would have been
              different. We then were trying to find
              <a
                href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/moo-pizza-honolulu"
                target="_blank">
                Moo Pizza
                </a>
              from when we were getting back to our room to drop our stuff off
              from the trip. However, we first found
              <a
                href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/waikiki-beachside-kitchen-honolulu-3"
                target="_blank">
                Waikiki Beachside Kitchen
              </a>
              and had mini kaula plate to shair. There was a really nice college
              student working there and was really great conversation when
              waiting and while eating our meal. Then a block further we found
              Moo Pizza and when asking what the most popular pizza was he said
              it was the Moo Special Pizza and thus we had to get it and ordered
              a small. We then took it to our room and was barely able to finish
              it. We then after the food coma went to the Brewery again and I
              tried another flight and meant to buy some beer from there but
              decided to instead get some
              <a
                href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/island-distillers-honolulu-2?osq=moonshine"
                target="_blank">
                moonshine
              </a>
              which is really good.
            </p>
            <p>
              The final day we had our flight back home at about 11:00am so all
              we did that day was pack up and and some breakfast at Marukame
              Udon.
