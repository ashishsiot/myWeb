          <h1>About me</h1>
          <p>
            I have always been interested in Social Sciences and Sciences.
            Within the years I have defined my set of skills through school,
            jobs, and projects. During my early years at my community college, I
            worked mainly in positions that gave my stronger soft skills while I
            was also learning them whilst also learning hard skills. One of the
            things I did and still volunteer for is as a Citizens Bond Oversight
            Committee (CBOC) member at the SJECCD, working with a team of people
            to monitor the use of bond money. I first learned this while also
            working as a senator with the Associated Student Government at
            Evergreen Valley College.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once I left to further my education at San Jose State University
            (SJSU) I started to gain a large interest in programming and data
            analysis. Through this, I was still defining my skills through the
            people I was interacting with (i.e. Electrical Engineers,
            Communications Studies, Computer Science, Psychology) to name a few.
            Through working with them I was able to gain my soft skills to have
            a deeper understanding to communicate with different fields of
            education both personally and professionally.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since COVID-19 I have been able to utilize my eagerness to learn new
            things to my advantage with learning IT Support and Creating this
            website. I am currently looking to find a company that can use my
            experience to their benefit and utilizes my understanding of how to
            work with people to get the job done.
