          <h1>About me</h1>
          <p>
            I have always been interested in Social Sciences and Sciences.
            Within the years I have refined my skill set through school, jobs,
            and projects. During my early years at community college, I worked
            mainly in positions that strengthened my soft skills whilst learning
            new hard skills. One of the things I did and still volunteer for is
            the Citizens Bond Oversight Committee (CBOC) as a member at the San
            Jose Evergreen Community College District. I have been working with
            a team of people to monitor the use of bond money within the SJECCD.
            I first learned this while also working as a senator with the
            Associated Student Government at Evergreen Valley College.
          </p>
          <p>
            I moved onto further my education at San Jose State University
            (SJSU) I started to gain a large interest in programming and data
            analysis. I was still refining my skills through the people I was
            interacting with (i.e. Electrical Engineers, Communications Studies,
            Computer Science, Psychology). By working with these different
            individuals, I was able to gain a deeper understanding on how to
            communicate with different fields of education both personally and
            professionally.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since COVID-19 I have been able to utilize my eagerness to learn new
            things to my advantage with learning IT Support and Creating this
            website. I am currently looking to find a company that can use my
            experience for their benefit and could utilize my understanding of
            how to work with people to get the job done.

            <p>
              This is a project that I have worked on for (x) days and took me
              about (x) hours to complete. The website utilizes HTML5 and CSS3.
              This was my first attempt on utilizing these programing languages
              to create a functional website. Next phase will be to make it
              mobile friendly.

            <p>
              Collaborated with a team of 2 classmates on a project that would
              allow 2-4 people to play Texas Hold’em. Operated with C language
              to allow users to play with each other, remember the winnings of
              each player, and score the games accordingly. We concluded with a
              somewhat effective application, however, learned that when
              programing the application the coded needed to be different for
              windows and Mac systems.

              Collaborated with a team of 3 to analyze 94.2 GB of raw data and

                ‘Aggressively Deduplicated Data’</a
              >. Since the words that were written were of no particular
              importance I presented to the group to use 'sha256' hash and this
              reduced the file size to approximately 82 GB to help maximize
              efficiency. Due to the limitations of Lab time and the size of the
              data we needed to use, we were unable to utilize all of the data.
              But with the data that we were able to process we were able to
              find that there was a significant amount of difference between our
              "aggressively Deduplicated data" and the UCSD data. The
              application used was Python and the libraries used were as
              followed: JSON, MySQL dB, and StringIO.

              application to plot a moving window of Nike’s portfolio and the
              portfolios of five other companies. Concluded with no significant
              findings to indicate Trump’s tweets could affect the stock market
              prices from tweets made early September of 2018 concerning Nike.

              My class worked with Sea4Ourselves, a non-project organization,
              and obtained 546 different sets of data to help them understand
              how people in the age group of 18 to 28 years of age understand
              ocean conservation. More specifically focused on the amount of
              knowledge of ocean conservation efforts within the community and
              to better understand young adults’ attitudes towards ocean
              conservation.
